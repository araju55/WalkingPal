Walking Pal is an app that you turn on when you are about to walk. When turned on, the 10-minute timer will start and after 10 minutes is up, you will have to enter a passcode. If you forget to enter the passcode, then the app will remind you to enter it and if after reminder, passcode is still not entered, then it will notify your selected contacts in the app that you are in trouble.
